## Background

As someone who frequently used YouTube-to-MP3 converters online, I have always been frustrated with how long the process takes. Converter websites are not the most reliable and will often take a long time to download what I need. Most of them are also littered with pop-up ads that make for a frustrating user experience.

That is why I wanted to create a fully local converter with no pop-up ads or data collection. I often felt unmotivated to download videos because of how annoying the online converters are to use so I wanted to save myself and maybe others from future headaches.

## Features
